# TASK-033.3: Test checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue - delete non-default queue

**Section**: 3. QueueManager Enhancements
**Subsection**: 3.6.3
**Task ID**: TASK-033.3

## Description

Add a test case for the `checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue` method to verify it correctly deletes non-default queues when they are empty (have zero jobs).

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/src/queue/queue-manager.ts` - `checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue()` method

## Current State

The `checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue` method:
- Checks if queue is empty (zero jobs)
- Deletes non-default queues when empty
- Does not delete default queue even when empty

The test file `tests/queue/queue-manager.test.ts` exists with previous tests including TASK-033.1 and TASK-033.2.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-033.2.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue` implementation
- [ ] Understand queue cleanup logic
- [ ] Understand default queue identification
- [ ] Review test setup from previous subtasks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Write test for non-default queue deletion
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should delete non-default queue when empty', async () => { ... })`
    - [ ] Arrange: 
      - [ ] Non-default queue with zero jobs
      - [ ] Mock `deleteQueue` method
    - [ ] Act: Call `checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue(queue)`
    - [ ] Assert: `deleteQueue` called

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Test must verify queue cleanup
  - Acceptance: Empty non-default queues are deleted
- [ ] Requirement 2: Test must verify queue emptiness check
  - Acceptance: Queue is checked for zero jobs before deletion

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle case where deleteQueue fails
- [ ] Verify queue emptiness is checked correctly

### Testing

- [ ] Run `npm run test:unit` to verify test executes
- [ ] Verify test passes consistently
- [ ] Verify existing tests still pass
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests only

### Documentation

- [ ] Add comments explaining queue cleanup logic

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes consistently
- [ ] Verify queue cleanup works
- [ ] Confirm test follows project conventions

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 3 – QueueManager Enhancements**
- **Execution Timing**: Should be executed after TASK-033.2
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-033.2: Test removeAgent - error handling
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - This is the third of 5 subtasks for TASK-033
  - Only non-default queues are deleted
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-033.2
- **Current State**: Test file exists with previous tests

## Related Tasks

- Parent: TASK-033 (Add tests for removeAgent and checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue)
- Previous: TASK-033.2 (Test removeAgent - error handling)
- Next: TASK-033.4 (Test checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue - don't delete default queue)
- Dependencies:
  - TASK-033.2: Test removeAgent - error handling
- Related:
  - TASK-033.1, TASK-033.2, TASK-033.4, TASK-033.5: Other subtasks

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: TESTING TASK

**Description**: This task involves writing a test case for `checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue` to verify non-default queue deletion.

**Definition of Done**: "A test case is written that verifies `checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue` correctly deletes non-default queues when they are empty. The test passes consistently. All changes have been committed to git and pushed to origin."

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to verify queue cleanup works so that empty non-default queues are removed.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: 
     - Test verifies empty non-default queues are deleted
     - Test passes consistently

### Automated Tests

The test case should be:

```typescript
describe('checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue', () => {
  it('should delete non-default queue when empty', async () => {
    // Arrange: Non-default queue with zero jobs
    // Act: checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue(queue)
    // Assert: deleteQueue called
  });
});
```

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Test verifies non-default queue deletion

### Git Commit and Push Requirements

- [ ] Test case added to `tests/queue/queue-manager.test.ts`
- [ ] Commit message follows project conventions (e.g., "test: add checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue non-default queue deletion test")
- [ ] Changes are pushed to origin
- [ ] Commit includes only this test case

### Final Checklist

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Test verifies non-default queue deletion
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Code pushed to origin
- [ ] Task marked as complete
