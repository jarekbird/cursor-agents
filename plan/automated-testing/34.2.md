# TASK-034.2: Test deleteQueue - default queue protection

**Section**: 3. QueueManager Enhancements
**Subsection**: 3.7.2
**Task ID**: TASK-034.2

## Description

Add a test case for the `deleteQueue` method to verify it correctly throws an error when attempting to delete the default queue. This protects the default queue from accidental deletion.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/src/queue/queue-manager.ts` - `deleteQueue()` method

## Current State

The `deleteQueue` method:
- Throws error if queue is default queue

The test file `tests/queue/queue-manager.test.ts` exists with previous tests including TASK-034.1.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-034.1.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `deleteQueue` default queue protection logic
- [ ] Understand how default queue is identified
- [ ] Review test setup from TASK-034.1

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Write test for default queue
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should throw error when attempting to delete default queue', async () => { ... })`
  - [ ] Arrange: Default queue name
  - [ ] Act: Call `deleteQueue('default')`
  - [ ] Assert: Throws error about not deleting default queue

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Test must verify default queue protection
  - Acceptance: Appropriate error thrown for default queue

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Verify error messages are descriptive
- [ ] Test with various default queue configurations

### Testing

- [ ] Run `npm run test:unit` to verify test executes
- [ ] Verify test passes consistently
- [ ] Verify existing tests still pass
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests only

### Documentation

- [ ] Add comments explaining why default queue is protected
- [ ] Document default queue protection

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes consistently
- [ ] Verify default queue protection works
- [ ] Confirm test follows project conventions

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 3 – QueueManager Enhancements**
- **Execution Timing**: Should be executed after TASK-034.1
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-034.1: Test deleteQueue - queue not found error
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Default queue protection prevents system instability
  - This is the second of 4 subtasks for TASK-034
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-034.1
- **Current State**: Test file exists with previous tests

## Related Tasks

- Parent: TASK-034 (Add tests for deleteQueue)
- Previous: TASK-034.1 (Test deleteQueue - queue not found error)
- Next: TASK-034.3 (Test deleteQueue - queue with jobs error)
- Dependencies:
  - TASK-034.1: Test deleteQueue - queue not found error
- Related:
  - TASK-034.1, TASK-034.3, TASK-034.4: Other subtasks

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: TESTING TASK

**Description**: This task involves writing a test case for `deleteQueue` default queue protection.

**Definition of Done**: "A test case is written that verifies `deleteQueue` correctly throws an error when attempting to delete the default queue. The test passes consistently. All changes have been committed to git and pushed to origin."

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to verify default queue protection works so that the default queue is never accidentally deleted.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: 
     - Test verifies default queue protection
     - Test passes consistently

### Automated Tests

The test case should be:

```typescript
describe('deleteQueue', () => {
  it('should throw error when attempting to delete default queue', async () => {
    // Arrange: Default queue
    // Act: deleteQueue('default')
    // Assert: Throws error about default queue
  });
});
```

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Test verifies default queue protection

### Git Commit and Push Requirements

- [ ] Test case added to `tests/queue/queue-manager.test.ts`
- [ ] Commit message follows project conventions (e.g., "test: add deleteQueue default queue protection test")
- [ ] Changes are pushed to origin
- [ ] Commit includes only this test case

### Final Checklist

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Test verifies default queue protection
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Code pushed to origin
- [ ] Task marked as complete
