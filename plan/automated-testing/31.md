# TASK-031: Add tests for addDelayedAgent

**Section**: 3. QueueManager Enhancements
**Subsection**: 3.4
**Task ID**: TASK-031

**NOTE**: This task has been split into granular subtasks:
- **TASK-031.1**: Test addDelayedAgent - non-task-operator queue
- **TASK-031.2**: Test addDelayedAgent - task-operator with existing jobs
- **TASK-031.3**: Test addDelayedAgent - task-operator with no existing jobs

Please execute the subtasks (31.1, 31.2, 31.3) instead of this parent task.

## Description

Add test cases for the `addDelayedAgent` method to verify it correctly adds delayed jobs for non-task-operator queues and handles task-operator queue special logic (checking for existing jobs before adding). The tests should verify job creation with correct delay, name, and data, and the skip logic for task-operator when jobs already exist.

**This task has been split into subtasks - see TASK-031.1 through TASK-031.3**
