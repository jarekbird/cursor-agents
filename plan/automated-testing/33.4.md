# TASK-033.4: Test checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue - don't delete default queue

**Section**: 3. QueueManager Enhancements
**Subsection**: 3.6.4
**Task ID**: TASK-033.4

## Description

Add a test case for the `checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue` method to verify it does NOT delete the default queue even when it is empty. This protects the default queue from accidental deletion.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/src/queue/queue-manager.ts` - `checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue()` method

## Current State

The `checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue` method:
- Does not delete default queue even when empty
- Only deletes non-default queues when empty

The test file `tests/queue/queue-manager.test.ts` exists with previous tests including TASK-033.1, TASK-033.2, and TASK-033.3.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-033.3.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue` default queue protection logic
- [ ] Understand how default queue is identified
- [ ] Review test setup from previous subtasks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Write test for default queue protection
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should not delete default queue even when empty', async () => { ... })`
    - [ ] Arrange: Default queue with zero jobs
    - [ ] Mock `deleteQueue` method
    - [ ] Act: Call `checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue(defaultQueue)`
    - [ ] Assert: `deleteQueue` not called

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Test must verify default queue protection
  - Acceptance: Default queue is not deleted even when empty
- [ ] Requirement 2: Test must verify deleteQueue is not called
  - Acceptance: `deleteQueue` is not invoked for default queue

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Verify default queue identification works correctly
- [ ] Test with various default queue configurations

### Testing

- [ ] Run `npm run test:unit` to verify test executes
- [ ] Verify test passes consistently
- [ ] Verify existing tests still pass
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests only

### Documentation

- [ ] Add comments explaining default queue protection
- [ ] Document why default queue is protected

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes consistently
- [ ] Verify default queue protection works
- [ ] Confirm test follows project conventions

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 3 – QueueManager Enhancements**
- **Execution Timing**: Should be executed after TASK-033.3
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-033.3: Test checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue - delete non-default queue
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - This is the fourth of 5 subtasks for TASK-033
  - Default queue protection is important for system stability
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-033.3
- **Current State**: Test file exists with previous tests

## Related Tasks

- Parent: TASK-033 (Add tests for removeAgent and checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue)
- Previous: TASK-033.3 (Test checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue - delete non-default queue)
- Next: TASK-033.5 (Test checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue - don't delete queue with jobs)
- Dependencies:
  - TASK-033.3: Test checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue - delete non-default queue
- Related:
  - TASK-033.1, TASK-033.2, TASK-033.3, TASK-033.5: Other subtasks

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: TESTING TASK

**Description**: This task involves writing a test case for `checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue` to verify default queue protection.

**Definition of Done**: "A test case is written that verifies `checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue` does NOT delete the default queue even when it is empty. The test passes consistently. All changes have been committed to git and pushed to origin."

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to verify default queue protection works so that the default queue is never accidentally deleted.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: 
     - Test verifies default queue is not deleted even when empty
     - Test passes consistently

### Automated Tests

The test case should be:

```typescript
describe('checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue', () => {
  it('should not delete default queue even when empty', async () => {
    // Arrange: Default queue with zero jobs
    // Act: checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue(defaultQueue)
    // Assert: deleteQueue not called
  });
});
```

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Test verifies default queue protection

### Git Commit and Push Requirements

- [ ] Test case added to `tests/queue/queue-manager.test.ts`
- [ ] Commit message follows project conventions (e.g., "test: add checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue default queue protection test")
- [ ] Changes are pushed to origin
- [ ] Commit includes only this test case

### Final Checklist

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Test verifies default queue protection
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Code pushed to origin
- [ ] Task marked as complete
