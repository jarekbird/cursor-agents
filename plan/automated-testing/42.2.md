# TASK-042.2: Add tests for GET /agents endpoint

**Section**: 5. HTTP/API Black-box Tests (App)
**Subsection**: 5.5.2
**Task ID**: TASK-042.2

## Description

Add test cases for the `GET /agents` endpoint to verify it correctly lists all agents across queues, filters null values, and handles errors appropriately.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/src/app.ts` - `GET /agents` endpoint
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/tests/app.test.ts` - existing test structure

## Current State

The `GET /agents` endpoint:
- Lists all agents across queues
- Filters null values from the results
- Returns 500 when listQueues rejects

The test file `tests/app.test.ts` exists with previous tests including TASK-042.1.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-042.1.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `GET /agents` endpoint implementation
- [ ] Understand how agents are listed across queues
- [ ] Understand null filtering logic
- [ ] Review test setup from TASK-042.1

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Write tests for GET /agents
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should list all agents and filter null values', async () => { ... })`
    - [ ] Arrange: Mock `listQueues` and `getAgentStatus` to return queue objects
    - [ ] Act: GET `/agents`
    - [ ] Assert: 
      - [ ] 200, agents array without nulls
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should return 500 when listQueues rejects', async () => { ... })`
    - [ ] Arrange: `listQueues` rejects
    - [ ] Act: GET `/agents`
    - [ ] Assert: 500, error message

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Test must verify GET /agents
  - Acceptance: Lists all agents, filters null values, handles errors
- [ ] Requirement 2: Test must verify null filtering
  - Acceptance: Null values are filtered from results

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle case where multiple agents exist
- [ ] Verify null filtering in GET /agents
- [ ] Test with various queue configurations

### Testing

- [ ] Run `npm run test:http` to verify all tests execute
- [ ] Verify all test cases pass
- [ ] Verify existing tests still pass
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests only

### Documentation

- [ ] Add comments explaining agent listing behavior
- [ ] Document null filtering approach

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all test cases pass consistently
- [ ] Verify agent listing works
- [ ] Verify null filtering works
- [ ] Confirm tests follow project conventions

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 5 – HTTP/API Black-box Tests (App)**
- **Execution Timing**: Should be executed after TASK-042.1
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-042.1: Add tests for POST /agents endpoint
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - This is the second of 4 subtasks for TASK-042
  - Null filtering in GET /agents is important
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-042.1
- **Current State**: Test file exists with previous tests

## Related Tasks

- Parent: TASK-042 (Add tests for /agents endpoints)
- Previous: TASK-042.1 (Add tests for POST /agents endpoint)
- Next: TASK-042.3 (Add tests for GET /agents/:name endpoint)
- Dependencies:
  - TASK-042.1: Add tests for POST /agents endpoint
- Related:
  - TASK-042.1, TASK-042.3, TASK-042.4: Other subtasks

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: TESTING TASK

**Description**: This task involves adding test cases for the `GET /agents` endpoint.

**Definition of Done**: "Test cases are added that verify `GET /agents` correctly lists all agents, filters null values, and handles errors. All tests pass consistently. All changes have been committed to git and pushed to origin."

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to verify agent listing works so that all agents can be retrieved.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Test verifies all agents are listed
     - Test verifies null values are filtered
     - Test verifies error handling works

### Automated Tests

Test cases should include:

```typescript
describe('GET /agents', () => {
  it('should list all agents and filter null values', async () => {
    // Arrange: Mock listQueues and getAgentStatus
    // Act: GET /agents
    // Assert: 200, agents array without nulls
  });
  
  it('should return 500 when listQueues rejects', async () => {
    // Arrange: listQueues rejects
    // Act: GET /agents
    // Assert: 500, error message
  });
});
```

- [ ] All test cases written and pass
- [ ] Tests verify agent listing
- [ ] Tests verify null filtering
- [ ] Tests verify error handling

### Git Commit and Push Requirements

- [ ] Test cases added to `tests/app.test.ts`
- [ ] Commit message follows project conventions (e.g., "test: add GET /agents endpoint tests")
- [ ] Changes are pushed to origin
- [ ] Commit includes only the test case additions

### Final Checklist

- [ ] All test cases written and pass
- [ ] Tests verify agent listing and null filtering
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Code pushed to origin
- [ ] Task marked as complete
