# TASK-042.4: Add tests for DELETE /agents/:name endpoint

**Section**: 5. HTTP/API Black-box Tests (App)
**Subsection**: 5.5.4
**Task ID**: TASK-042.4

## Description

Add test cases for the `DELETE /agents/:name` endpoint to verify it correctly deletes agents and handles errors appropriately.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/src/app.ts` - `DELETE /agents/:name` endpoint
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/tests/app.test.ts` - existing test structure

## Current State

The `DELETE /agents/:name` endpoint:
- Deletes an agent
- Returns 500 when removeAgent throws

The test file `tests/app.test.ts` exists with previous tests including TASK-042.1, TASK-042.2, and TASK-042.3.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-042.3, completing TASK-042.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `DELETE /agents/:name` endpoint implementation
- [ ] Understand `removeAgent` usage
- [ ] Review test setup from previous subtasks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Write tests for DELETE /agents/:name
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should delete agent successfully', async () => { ... })`
    - [ ] Arrange: Mock `removeAgent` to resolve
    - [ ] Act: DELETE `/agents/test`
    - [ ] Assert: 200, success
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should return 500 when removeAgent throws', async () => { ... })`
    - [ ] Arrange: `removeAgent` throws error
    - [ ] Act: DELETE `/agents/test`
    - [ ] Assert: 500, error message

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Test must verify DELETE /agents/:name
  - Acceptance: Deletes agents successfully, handles errors
- [ ] Requirement 2: Test must verify error handling
  - Acceptance: Errors return 500 with descriptive messages

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle case where agent doesn't exist
- [ ] Verify error messages are descriptive
- [ ] Test with various agent configurations

### Testing

- [ ] Run `npm run test:http` to verify all tests execute
- [ ] Verify all test cases pass
- [ ] Verify existing tests still pass
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests only

### Documentation

- [ ] Add comments explaining agent deletion behavior
- [ ] Note error handling approach

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all test cases pass consistently
- [ ] Verify agent deletion works
- [ ] Verify error handling works
- [ ] Confirm tests follow project conventions

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 5 – HTTP/API Black-box Tests (App)**
- **Execution Timing**: Should be executed after TASK-042.3 (completes TASK-042)
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-042.3: Add tests for GET /agents/:name endpoint
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - This is the fourth and final subtask for TASK-042
  - Error messages should match implementation exactly
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-042.3
- **Current State**: Test file exists with previous tests

## Related Tasks

- Parent: TASK-042 (Add tests for /agents endpoints)
- Previous: TASK-042.3 (Add tests for GET /agents/:name endpoint)
- Next: TASK-043 (Add tests for /task-operator endpoints)
- Dependencies:
  - TASK-042.3: Add tests for GET /agents/:name endpoint
- Related:
  - TASK-042.1, TASK-042.2, TASK-042.3: Other subtasks

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: TESTING TASK

**Description**: This task involves adding test cases for the `DELETE /agents/:name` endpoint.

**Definition of Done**: "Test cases are added that verify `DELETE /agents/:name` correctly deletes agents and handles errors. All tests pass consistently. All changes have been committed to git and pushed to origin."

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to verify agent deletion works so that agents can be removed.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Test verifies agents are deleted successfully
     - Test verifies errors are handled gracefully

### Automated Tests

Test cases should include:

```typescript
describe('DELETE /agents/:name', () => {
  it('should delete agent successfully', async () => {
    // Arrange: Mock removeAgent
    // Act: DELETE /agents/test
    // Assert: 200, success
  });
  
  it('should return 500 when removeAgent throws', async () => {
    // Arrange: removeAgent throws
    // Act: DELETE /agents/test
    // Assert: 500, error message
  });
});
```

- [ ] All test cases written and pass
- [ ] Tests verify agent deletion
- [ ] Tests verify error handling

### Git Commit and Push Requirements

- [ ] Test cases added to `tests/app.test.ts`
- [ ] Commit message follows project conventions (e.g., "test: add DELETE /agents/:name endpoint tests")
- [ ] Changes are pushed to origin
- [ ] Commit includes only the test case additions

### Final Checklist

- [ ] All test cases written and pass
- [ ] Tests verify agent deletion
- [ ] Tests verify error handling
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Code pushed to origin
- [ ] Task marked as complete
- [ ] **TASK-042 (all subtasks) is complete**
