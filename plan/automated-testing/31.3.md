# TASK-031.3: Test addDelayedAgent - task-operator with no existing jobs

**Section**: 3. QueueManager Enhancements
**Subsection**: 3.4.3
**Task ID**: TASK-031.3

## Description

Add a test case for the `addDelayedAgent` method to verify it correctly adds delayed jobs for the task-operator queue when no existing jobs are present. The test should verify that the job is created and metadata is returned.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/src/queue/queue-manager.ts` - `addDelayedAgent()` method
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/tests/queue/queue-manager.test.ts` - existing test structure

## Current State

The `addDelayedAgent` method:
- For task-operator queue: checks `hasExistingJobs` first
- If no jobs exist: adds delayed job and returns job metadata

The test file `tests/queue/queue-manager.test.ts` exists with previous tests including TASK-031.1 and TASK-031.2.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-031.2, completing TASK-031.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `addDelayedAgent` task-operator add logic
- [ ] Understand `hasExistingJobs` usage (from TASK-030)
- [ ] Review test setup from previous subtasks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Write test for task-operator with no existing jobs
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should add delayed job for task-operator when no jobs exist', async () => { ... })`
  - [ ] Arrange: 
    - [ ] Queue name `'task-operator'`
    - [ ] Mock `hasExistingJobs` to return `false`
  - [ ] Act: Call `addDelayedAgent(queue, config, delay)`
  - [ ] Assert: 
    - [ ] Queue `add` called
    - [ ] Job metadata returned

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Test must verify task-operator add logic
  - Acceptance: Adds job when no existing jobs
- [ ] Requirement 2: Test must verify job parameters
  - Acceptance: Delay, name, and data are set correctly

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle case where queue `add` fails
- [ ] Verify job name format is correct
- [ ] Test with various delay values

### Testing

- [ ] Run `npm run test:unit` to verify all tests execute
- [ ] Verify all test cases pass
- [ ] Verify existing tests still pass
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests only

### Documentation

- [ ] Add comments explaining task-operator add behavior

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all test cases pass consistently
- [ ] Verify job creation works
- [ ] Confirm tests follow project conventions

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 3 – QueueManager Enhancements**
- **Execution Timing**: Should be executed after TASK-031.2 (completes TASK-031)
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-031.2: Test addDelayedAgent - task-operator with existing jobs
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - This is the third and final subtask for TASK-031
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-031.2
- **Current State**: Test file exists with previous tests

## Related Tasks

- Parent: TASK-031 (Add tests for addDelayedAgent)
- Previous: TASK-031.2 (Test addDelayedAgent - task-operator with existing jobs)
- Next: TASK-032 (Add tests for getAgentStatus and findAgentQueue)
- Dependencies:
  - TASK-031.2: Test addDelayedAgent - task-operator with existing jobs
- Related:
  - TASK-031.1, TASK-031.2: Other subtasks

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: TESTING TASK

**Description**: This task involves writing a test case for `addDelayedAgent` when task-operator queue has no existing jobs.

**Definition of Done**: "A test case is written that verifies `addDelayedAgent` correctly adds delayed jobs for task-operator queue when no existing jobs are present. The test passes consistently. All changes have been committed to git and pushed to origin."

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to verify task-operator add logic works so that jobs can be added when no existing jobs are present.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Test verifies add when no jobs exist
     - Test verifies job metadata is returned

### Automated Tests

The test case should be:

```typescript
describe('addDelayedAgent', () => {
  it('should add delayed job for task-operator when no jobs exist', async () => {
    // Arrange: task-operator queue, hasExistingJobs returns false
    const mockQueue = {
      add: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: 'job-1', name: 'agent:test' }),
    };
    const queueManager = new QueueManager(mockRedis);
    jest.spyOn(queueManager, 'hasExistingJobs').mockResolvedValue(false);
    
    // Act
    const result = await queueManager.addDelayedAgent(mockQueue, config, delay);
    
    // Assert
    expect(mockQueue.add).toHaveBeenCalled();
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Tests verify task-operator add logic

### Git Commit and Push Requirements

- [ ] Test case added to `tests/queue/queue-manager.test.ts`
- [ ] Commit message follows project conventions (e.g., "test: add addDelayedAgent task-operator no existing jobs test")
- [ ] Changes are pushed to origin
- [ ] Commit includes only this test case

### Final Checklist

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Tests verify job creation
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Code pushed to origin
- [ ] Task marked as complete
- [ ] **TASK-031 (all subtasks) is complete**
