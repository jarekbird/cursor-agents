# TASK-043.1: Add tests for POST /task-operator endpoint

**Section**: 5. HTTP/API Black-box Tests (App)
**Subsection**: 5.6.1
**Task ID**: TASK-043.1

## Description

Add test cases for the `POST /task-operator` endpoint to verify it correctly enables the task operator by setting the system setting and enqueueing a one-time agent. The tests should verify success cases and error handling.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/src/app.ts` - `POST /task-operator` endpoint
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/tests/app.test.ts` - existing test structure

## Current State

The `POST /task-operator` endpoint:
- Enables task operator by setting system setting
- Enqueues one-time agent
- Returns 200 with agent info on success
- Returns 500 when addOneTimeAgent throws

The test file `tests/app.test.ts` exists but may not have comprehensive `POST /task-operator` endpoint tests.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-042. This is the first subtask of TASK-043.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `POST /task-operator` endpoint implementation
- [ ] Understand `setSystemSetting` and `addOneTimeAgent` usage
- [ ] Review existing `app.test.ts` structure

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Write tests for POST /task-operator
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should enable task operator successfully', async () => { ... })`
    - [ ] Arrange: 
      - [ ] Mock `setSystemSetting` to return `true`
      - [ ] Mock `addOneTimeAgent` to return job
    - [ ] Act: POST `/task-operator`
    - [ ] Assert: 
      - [ ] 200, success JSON with agent info
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should still succeed when setSystemSetting returns false', async () => { ... })`
    - [ ] Arrange: `setSystemSetting` returns `false` but `addOneTimeAgent` succeeds
    - [ ] Act: POST `/task-operator`
    - [ ] Assert: 
      - [ ] 200, warning logged
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should return 500 when addOneTimeAgent throws', async () => { ... })`
    - [ ] Arrange: `addOneTimeAgent` throws
    - [ ] Act: POST `/task-operator`
    - [ ] Assert: 
      - [ ] 500, error "Failed to enqueue task operator"

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Test must verify POST success cases
  - Acceptance: Task operator is enabled successfully
- [ ] Requirement 2: Test must verify POST error handling
  - Acceptance: Errors return 500 with descriptive message

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle case where setSystemSetting fails but addOneTimeAgent succeeds
- [ ] Verify warning logging when setSystemSetting returns false
- [ ] Test with various error types

### Testing

- [ ] Run `npm run test:http` to verify all tests execute
- [ ] Verify all test cases pass
- [ ] Verify existing tests still pass
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests only

### Documentation

- [ ] Add comments explaining task operator enable flow
- [ ] Document why setSystemSetting false is handled as warning

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all test cases pass consistently
- [ ] Verify enable functionality works
- [ ] Verify error handling works
- [ ] Confirm tests follow project conventions

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 5 – HTTP/API Black-box Tests (App)**
- **Execution Timing**: Should be executed after TASK-042
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-042: Add tests for /agents endpoints
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - POST endpoint enables task operator and enqueues agent
  - setSystemSetting false in POST is warning, not error
  - This is the first of 2 subtasks for TASK-043
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-042
- **Current State**: Test file exists but may not have comprehensive POST /task-operator endpoint tests

## Related Tasks

- Parent: TASK-043 (Add tests for /task-operator endpoints)
- Next: TASK-043.2 (Add tests for DELETE /task-operator endpoint)
- Dependencies:
  - TASK-042: Add tests for /agents endpoints
- Related:
  - TASK-043.2: Will test DELETE endpoint

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: TESTING TASK

**Description**: This task involves adding test cases for the `POST /task-operator` endpoint.

**Definition of Done**: "Test cases are added that verify `POST /task-operator` correctly enables task operator, handles various success scenarios, and handles errors gracefully. All tests pass consistently. All changes have been committed to git and pushed to origin."

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to verify task operator enablement works so that task processing can be started.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: 
     - Test verifies task operator is enabled successfully
     - Test verifies agent is enqueued
     - Test passes consistently

### Automated Tests

Test cases should include:

```typescript
describe('POST /task-operator', () => {
  it('should enable task operator successfully', async () => {
    // Arrange: setSystemSetting returns true, addOneTimeAgent returns job
    // Act: POST /task-operator
    // Assert: 200, success JSON with agent info
  });
  
  it('should still succeed when setSystemSetting returns false', async () => {
    // Arrange: setSystemSetting false, addOneTimeAgent succeeds
    // Act & Assert: 200, warning logged
  });
  
  it('should return 500 when addOneTimeAgent throws', async () => {
    // Arrange: addOneTimeAgent throws
    // Act & Assert: 500, "Failed to enqueue task operator"
  });
});
```

- [ ] All test cases written and pass
- [ ] Tests verify enable functionality
- [ ] Tests verify error handling

### Git Commit and Push Requirements

- [ ] Test cases added to `tests/app.test.ts`
- [ ] Commit message follows project conventions (e.g., "test: add POST /task-operator endpoint tests")
- [ ] Changes are pushed to origin
- [ ] Commit includes only the test case additions

### Final Checklist

- [ ] All test cases written and pass
- [ ] Tests verify enable functionality
- [ ] Tests verify error handling
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Code pushed to origin
- [ ] Task marked as complete
