# TASK-047.1: Add tests for list_queues MCP tool

**Section**: 6. MCP Server Black-box Tests
**Subsection**: 6.2.1
**Task ID**: TASK-047.1

## Description

Add comprehensive test cases for the `list_queues` MCP tool to verify it correctly lists all queues with their info. The tests should verify it interacts with QueueManager correctly and returns appropriate JSON responses.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/src/mcp/server.ts` - `list_queues` tool handler
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/tests/mcp/server.test.ts` - existing test structure

## Current State

The `list_queues` MCP tool:
- Lists all queues with their info
- Returns MCP response with JSON containing queues array

The test file `tests/mcp/server.test.ts` exists but may not have comprehensive `list_queues` tool tests.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-046. This is the first subtask of TASK-047.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `list_queues` MCP tool implementation
- [ ] Understand `QueueManager.listQueues` and `getQueueInfo` usage
- [ ] Review existing `mcp/server.test.ts` structure
- [ ] Understand MCP error response format (`isError: true`)

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Write tests for list_queues
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should list all queues with info', async () => { ... })`
    - [ ] Arrange: 
      - [ ] Mock `listQueues` and `getQueueInfo` to return queue objects
    - [ ] Act: Call `list_queues` tool
    - [ ] Assert: 
      - [ ] JSON contains `queues` array
      - [ ] Queue objects have expected structure
      - [ ] All queues are included

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Test must verify list_queues
  - Acceptance: Returns queues array with correct structure
- [ ] Requirement 2: Test must verify QueueManager interaction
  - Acceptance: Correctly calls QueueManager methods

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle case where listQueues throws
- [ ] Verify queue info structure
- [ ] Test with various queue states

### Testing

- [ ] Run `npm run test:unit` to verify all tests execute
- [ ] Verify all test cases pass
- [ ] Verify existing tests still pass
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests only

### Documentation

- [ ] Add comments explaining queue tool behavior
- [ ] Document queue info structure

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all test cases pass consistently
- [ ] Verify queue tools work correctly
- [ ] Confirm tests follow project conventions

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 6 – MCP Server Black-box Tests**
- **Execution Timing**: Should be executed after TASK-046
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-046: Extend mcp/server.test.ts for JSON payload assertions
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Queue tools provide MCP access to queue management
  - This is the first of 3 subtasks for TASK-047
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-046
- **Current State**: Test file exists but may not have comprehensive queue tool tests

## Related Tasks

- Parent: TASK-047 (Add tests for queue-related MCP tools)
- Next: TASK-047.2 (Add tests for get_queue_info MCP tool)
- Dependencies:
  - TASK-046: Extend mcp/server.test.ts for JSON payload assertions
- Related:
  - TASK-047.2, TASK-047.3: Other subtasks

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: TESTING TASK

**Description**: This task involves adding test cases for the `list_queues` MCP tool.

**Definition of Done**: "Test cases are added that verify `list_queues` MCP tool correctly lists all queues with their info and returns appropriate JSON responses. All tests pass consistently. All changes have been committed to git and pushed to origin."

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to verify queue listing works so that MCP clients can see all queues.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: 
     - Test verifies queues array is returned
     - Test verifies queue info structure is correct
     - Test passes consistently

### Automated Tests

Test cases should include:

```typescript
describe('list_queues MCP tool', () => {
  it('should list all queues with info', async () => {
    // Arrange: Mock listQueues and getQueueInfo
    mockQueueManager.listQueues.mockReturnValue(['q1', 'q2']);
    mockQueueManager.getQueueInfo.mockImplementation((name) => ({
      name,
      waiting: 0,
      active: 0,
    }));
    
    // Act: Call list_queues tool
    // Assert: JSON contains queues array with queue info
  });
});
```

- [ ] All test cases written and pass
- [ ] Tests verify list_queues functionality

### Git Commit and Push Requirements

- [ ] Test cases added to `tests/mcp/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Commit message follows project conventions (e.g., "test: add list_queues MCP tool tests")
- [ ] Changes are pushed to origin
- [ ] Commit includes only the test case additions

### Final Checklist

- [ ] All test cases written and pass
- [ ] Tests verify list_queues
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Code pushed to origin
- [ ] Task marked as complete
