# TASK-010.3: Test getNextReadyTask ordering logic (order ASC then id ASC)

**Section**: 1. DatabaseService Unit Tests
**Subsection**: 1.7.3
**Task ID**: TASK-010.3

## Description

Add a test case for the `getNextReadyTask` method to verify it correctly orders tasks by `"order"` ASC, then `id` ASC, and returns the task with the lowest order (and lowest id when orders are equal). This verifies the ordering logic.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/src/services/database-service.ts` (lines 111-135) - `getNextReadyTask()` method

## Current State

The `getNextReadyTask` method:
- Orders by `"order"` ASC, then `id` ASC
- Returns the first matching task

The test file `tests/services/database-service.test.ts` exists with previous tests including TASK-010.1 and TASK-010.2.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-010.2.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `getNextReadyTask` ordering implementation
- [ ] Understand ordering logic: order ASC, then id ASC
- [ ] Review test setup from previous subtasks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Set up test database with tasks table
  - [ ] Create `tasks` table with required fields (may reuse from previous subtasks)
- [ ] Step 2: Write test for ordering logic
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should return task with lowest order then id', () => { ... })`
  - [ ] Arrange: Insert multiple tasks with status IN (0, 4):
    - [ ] Task 1: `status=0`, `order=10`, `id=1`
    - [ ] Task 2: `status=0`, `order=5`, `id=2` (lowest order, should be returned)
    - [ ] Task 3: `status=4`, `order=5`, `id=3` (same order, higher id)
    - [ ] Task 4: `status=0`, `order=5`, `id=1` (same order, lower id than task 3)
  - [ ] Act: Call `getNextReadyTask()`
  - [ ] Assert: Returns Task 2 or Task 4 (lowest order=5, then lowest id among order=5 tasks)

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Test must verify ordering by order ASC
  - Acceptance: Task with lowest `order` is returned first
- [ ] Requirement 2: Test must verify ordering by id ASC when orders equal
  - Acceptance: When orders are equal, task with lowest `id` is returned
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test must set up database correctly
  - Acceptance: `tasks` table exists with test data showing ordering

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle case where multiple tasks have same order
- [ ] Verify ordering with tasks having different orders
- [ ] Test edge cases (negative orders, zero orders, etc.)

### Testing

- [ ] Run `npm run test:unit` to verify test executes
- [ ] Verify test passes consistently
- [ ] Verify test is isolated
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests only

### Documentation

- [ ] Add comments explaining ordering logic
- [ ] Document order ASC then id ASC behavior

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes consistently
- [ ] Verify ordering logic works correctly
- [ ] Confirm test follows project conventions

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 1 – DatabaseService Unit Tests**
- **Execution Timing**: Should be executed after TASK-010.2
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-004: Create a new test file for DatabaseService
  - TASK-010.2: Test getNextReadyTask with tasks - status filtering
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Use in-memory database for isolation
  - Create `tasks` table schema in test setup
  - This is the third of 4 subtasks for TASK-010
  - Ordering: order ASC, then id ASC
  - Test should verify both order and id ordering
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-010.2
- **Current State**: Test file exists with previous tests

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: TESTING TASK

**Description**: This task involves writing a test case for `getNextReadyTask` ordering logic.

**Definition of Done**: "A test case is written that verifies `getNextReadyTask` correctly orders tasks by `order` ASC then `id` ASC and returns the task with lowest order (and lowest id when orders are equal). The test passes consistently. All changes have been committed to git and pushed to origin."

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to verify ordering logic works so that tasks are processed in the correct order.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: 
     - Test verifies ordering by `order` ASC then `id` ASC
     - Test verifies lowest order task is returned first
     - Test verifies lowest id is returned when orders are equal

### Automated Tests

The test case should be:

```typescript
describe('getNextReadyTask', () => {
  it('should return task with lowest order then id', () => {
    // Arrange: Insert tasks with varying order and id
    const db = createTestDatabase();
    db.exec(`CREATE TABLE tasks (...)`);
    db.exec(`INSERT INTO tasks (id, prompt, "order", uuid, status) VALUES 
      (1, 'task1', 10, 'uuid1', 0),
      (2, 'task2', 5, 'uuid2', 0),
      (3, 'task3', 5, 'uuid3', 4),
      (4, 'task4', 5, 'uuid4', 0)`);
    const service = new DatabaseService(':memory:');
    
    // Act
    const result = service.getNextReadyTask();
    
    // Assert
    expect(result).not.toBeNull();
    expect(result.order).toBe(5); // Lowest order
    // If multiple with order=5, should have lowest id
  });
});
```

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Test verifies ordering logic

### Git Commit and Push Requirements

- [ ] Test case added to `tests/services/database-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Commit message follows project conventions (e.g., "test: add getNextReadyTask ordering logic test")
- [ ] Changes are pushed to origin
- [ ] Commit includes only this test case

### Final Checklist

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Test verifies ordering logic
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Code pushed to origin
- [ ] Task marked as complete
