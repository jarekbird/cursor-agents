# TASK-046.4: Enhance MCP tests - delete_agent JSON structure assertions

**Section**: 6. MCP Server Black-box Tests
**Subsection**: 6.1.4
**Task ID**: TASK-046.4

## Description

Enhance the existing test for the `delete_agent` MCP tool to add comprehensive JSON payload assertions. The test should verify that `content[0].text` is valid JSON and assert the exact structure (keys, types, and important messages) for the delete_agent tool.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/src/mcp/server.ts` - `delete_agent` tool handler
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/tests/mcp/server.test.ts` - existing test structure

## Current State

The `delete_agent` MCP tool:
- Deletes an agent
- Returns MCP response with `content[0].text` containing JSON
- JSON should contain success/error structure

The test file `tests/mcp/server.test.ts` exists with previous tests including TASK-046.1, TASK-046.2, and TASK-046.3.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-046.3.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `delete_agent` tool handler implementation
- [ ] Understand MCP response format (`content[0].text` as JSON)
- [ ] Review test setup from previous subtasks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Enhance existing delete_agent test with JSON assertions
  - [ ] Find existing test for delete_agent
  - [ ] Add JSON parsing: `const content = JSON.parse(response.content[0].text)`
  - [ ] Assert success/error structure
  - [ ] Assert types are correct
  - [ ] Assert error messages when deletion fails

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Test must verify JSON is valid
  - Acceptance: `content[0].text` parses as valid JSON
- [ ] Requirement 2: Test must verify structure
  - Acceptance: All required keys are present with correct types
- [ ] Requirement 3: Test must verify error structure
  - Acceptance: Error JSON structure is consistent

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Verify error JSON structures are consistent
- [ ] Test with various deletion scenarios

### Testing

- [ ] Run `npm run test:unit` to verify test executes
- [ ] Verify test passes consistently
- [ ] Verify existing tests still pass
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests only

### Documentation

- [ ] Add comments explaining JSON structure assertions
- [ ] Document expected JSON schema for delete_agent

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes consistently
- [ ] Verify JSON parsing works
- [ ] Verify structure assertions work
- [ ] Confirm test follows project conventions

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 6 – MCP Server Black-box Tests**
- **Execution Timing**: Should be executed after TASK-046.3
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-046.3: Enhance MCP tests - get_agent_status JSON structure assertions
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - This is the fourth of 7 subtasks for TASK-046
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-046.3
- **Current State**: Test file exists with previous tests

## Related Tasks

- Parent: TASK-046 (Extend mcp/server.test.ts for JSON payload assertions)
- Previous: TASK-046.3 (Enhance MCP tests - get_agent_status JSON structure assertions)
- Next: TASK-046.5 (Enhance MCP tests - list_queues JSON structure assertions)
- Dependencies:
  - TASK-046.3: Enhance MCP tests - get_agent_status JSON structure assertions
- Related:
  - TASK-046.1, TASK-046.2, TASK-046.3, TASK-046.5 through TASK-046.7: Other subtasks

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: TESTING TASK

**Description**: This task involves enhancing the delete_agent MCP tool test with JSON structure assertions.

**Definition of Done**: "The delete_agent MCP tool test is enhanced with JSON parsing and structure assertions. Test verifies exact JSON structure (success/error). The test passes consistently. All changes have been committed to git and pushed to origin."

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to verify JSON structure is correct so that MCP clients receive expected data.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: 
     - Test verifies JSON is valid
     - Test verifies success/error structure is correct

### Automated Tests

Test enhancements should include:

```typescript
describe('delete_agent MCP tool', () => {
  it('should return valid JSON with success/error structure', async () => {
    // Arrange & Act
    // Assert
    const content = JSON.parse(response.content[0].text);
    // Assert success or error structure
  });
});
```

- [ ] Test enhanced with JSON assertions
- [ ] Tests verify JSON validity and structure

### Git Commit and Push Requirements

- [ ] Test enhancements added to `tests/mcp/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Commit message follows project conventions (e.g., "test: enhance delete_agent MCP tool with JSON structure assertions")
- [ ] Changes are pushed to origin
- [ ] Commit includes only the test enhancements

### Final Checklist

- [ ] Test enhanced with JSON assertions
- [ ] Tests verify JSON validity and structure
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Code pushed to origin
- [ ] Task marked as complete
