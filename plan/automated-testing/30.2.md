# TASK-030.2: Test hasExistingJobs - excludeActive=true with only active jobs

**Section**: 3. QueueManager Enhancements
**Subsection**: 3.3.2
**Task ID**: TASK-030.2

## Description

Add a test case for the `hasExistingJobs` method to verify it correctly handles the `excludeActive` parameter when only active jobs match. The test should verify that when `excludeActive` is true and only active jobs match, the method returns false.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/src/queue/queue-manager.ts` - `hasExistingJobs()` method
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/tests/queue/queue-manager.test.ts` - existing test structure

## Current State

The `hasExistingJobs` method:
- Can exclude active jobs from the check
- Returns `false` when only active jobs match and `excludeActive` is true

The test file `tests/queue/queue-manager.test.ts` exists with previous tests including TASK-030.1.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-030.1.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `hasExistingJobs` excludeActive logic
- [ ] Understand `excludeActive` parameter behavior
- [ ] Review test setup from TASK-030.1

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Write test for excludeActive=true with only active jobs
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should return false when only active jobs match and excludeActive is true', async () => { ... })`
  - [ ] Arrange: 
    - [ ] Mock queue with only active jobs matching
    - [ ] No waiting or delayed jobs
    - [ ] Set `excludeActive=true`
  - [ ] Act: Call `hasExistingJobs(queue, 'agent:test', true)`
  - [ ] Assert: Returns `false`

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Test must verify excludeActive behavior
  - Acceptance: Active jobs are excluded when `excludeActive=true`
- [ ] Requirement 2: Test must verify return value
  - Acceptance: Returns false when only active jobs match

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Verify excludeActive works correctly with mixed job states
- [ ] Test with various job configurations

### Testing

- [ ] Run `npm run test:unit` to verify all tests execute
- [ ] Verify all test cases pass
- [ ] Verify existing tests still pass
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests only

### Documentation

- [ ] Add comments explaining excludeActive parameter behavior

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all test cases pass consistently
- [ ] Verify excludeActive works
- [ ] Confirm tests follow project conventions

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 3 – QueueManager Enhancements**
- **Execution Timing**: Should be executed after TASK-030.1
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-030.1: Test hasExistingJobs - matching jobs with excludeActive=false
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - `excludeActive` prevents false positives from currently running jobs
  - This is the second of 3 subtasks for TASK-030
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-030.1
- **Current State**: Test file exists with previous tests

## Related Tasks

- Parent: TASK-030 (Add tests for hasExistingJobs)
- Previous: TASK-030.1 (Test hasExistingJobs - matching jobs with excludeActive=false)
- Next: TASK-030.3 (Test hasExistingJobs - error handling)
- Dependencies:
  - TASK-030.1: Test hasExistingJobs - matching jobs with excludeActive=false
- Related:
  - TASK-030.1, TASK-030.3: Other subtasks

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: TESTING TASK

**Description**: This task involves writing a test case for `hasExistingJobs` when excludeActive is true and only active jobs match.

**Definition of Done**: "A test case is written that verifies `hasExistingJobs` correctly returns false when only active jobs match and excludeActive is true. The test passes consistently. All changes have been committed to git and pushed to origin."

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to verify excludeActive works so that active jobs can be excluded from checks.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Test verifies active jobs are excluded when flag is true
     - Test verifies method returns false when only active jobs match

### Automated Tests

The test case should be:

```typescript
describe('hasExistingJobs', () => {
  it('should return false when only active jobs match and excludeActive is true', async () => {
    // Arrange: Only active jobs match
    const mockQueue = {
      getWaiting: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue([]),
      getActive: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue([
        { id: '1', name: 'agent:test', data: {} },
      ]),
      getDelayed: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue([]),
    };
    
    // Act
    const result = await queueManager.hasExistingJobs(mockQueue, 'agent:test', true);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Tests verify excludeActive behavior

### Git Commit and Push Requirements

- [ ] Test case added to `tests/queue/queue-manager.test.ts`
- [ ] Commit message follows project conventions (e.g., "test: add hasExistingJobs excludeActive=true test")
- [ ] Changes are pushed to origin
- [ ] Commit includes only this test case

### Final Checklist

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Tests verify excludeActive behavior
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Code pushed to origin
- [ ] Task marked as complete
