# TASK-037.3: Test task-operator internal jobs - no tasks/lock held case (5000ms delay)

**Section**: 4. PromptProcessor Enhancements
**Subsection**: 4.3.3
**Task ID**: TASK-037.3

## Description

Add a test case for task-operator internal jobs to verify that when no tasks are available or the lock is held, the job is re-enqueued with a 5000ms delay. This verifies the retry behavior when work is temporarily unavailable.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/src/queue/prompt-processor.ts` - task-operator internal job handling

## Current State

The `PromptProcessor.process()` method:
- Based on result, re-enqueues with appropriate delay:
  - No tasks/lock held: ~5000ms delay

The test file `tests/queue/prompt-processor.test.ts` exists with previous tests including TASK-037.1 and TASK-037.2.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-037.2.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `PromptProcessor.process()` task-operator handling
- [ ] Understand `TaskOperatorService.processNextTask()` return values for no tasks/lock held
- [ ] Review delay logic (5000ms)
- [ ] Review test setup from previous subtasks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Write test for no tasks/lock held
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should re-enqueue with 5000ms delay when no tasks or lock held', async () => { ... })`
  - [ ] Arrange: 
    - [ ] `processNextTask` returns `{ processed: false, reason: 'no_tasks' }` or `'lock_held'`
  - [ ] Act: Call `promptProcessor.process(job)`
  - [ ] Assert: 
    - [ ] `addDelayedAgent` called with delay ~5000ms

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Test must verify no tasks/lock held case
  - Acceptance: Re-enqueue with 5000ms delay
- [ ] Requirement 2: Test must verify delay value
  - Acceptance: Delay is approximately 5000ms (allow small variance)

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Test with both 'no_tasks' and 'lock_held' reasons
- [ ] Verify delay values are approximately correct

### Testing

- [ ] Run `npm run test:unit` to verify test executes
- [ ] Verify test passes consistently
- [ ] Verify existing tests still pass
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests only

### Documentation

- [ ] Add comments explaining retry behavior
- [ ] Document why 5000ms delay is used for retries

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes consistently
- [ ] Verify delay logic works
- [ ] Confirm test follows project conventions

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 4 – PromptProcessor Enhancements**
- **Execution Timing**: Should be executed after TASK-037.2
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-037.2: Test task-operator internal jobs - processed task case
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Delay of 5000ms for normal retry cases
  - Re-enqueueing ensures task operator keeps checking for work
  - This is the third of 5 subtasks for TASK-037
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-037.2
- **Current State**: Test file exists with previous tests

- Dependencies:
  - TASK-037.2: Test task-operator internal jobs - processed task case

  - TASK-037.1, TASK-037.2, TASK-037.4, TASK-037.5: Other subtasks

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: TESTING TASK

**Description**: This task involves writing a test case for task-operator internal jobs when no tasks or lock held.

**Definition of Done**: "A test case is written that verifies task-operator internal jobs are re-enqueued with 5000ms delay when no tasks are available or lock is held. The test passes consistently. All changes have been committed to git and pushed to origin."

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to verify retry behavior works so that task operator keeps checking when work is temporarily unavailable.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: 
     - Test verifies re-enqueue occurs with 5000ms delay
     - Test passes consistently

### Automated Tests

The test case should be:

```typescript
describe('task-operator internal jobs', () => {
  it('should re-enqueue with 5000ms delay when no tasks or lock held', async () => {
    // Arrange: processNextTask returns { processed: false, reason: 'no_tasks' }
    // Act: promptProcessor.process(job)
    // Assert: addDelayedAgent called with delay ~5000ms
  });
});
```

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Test verifies delay logic

### Git Commit and Push Requirements

- [ ] Test case added to `tests/queue/prompt-processor.test.ts`
- [ ] Commit message follows project conventions (e.g., "test: add task-operator no tasks/lock held case test")
- [ ] Changes are pushed to origin
- [ ] Commit includes only this test case

### Final Checklist

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Test verifies delay logic
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Code pushed to origin
- [ ] Task marked as complete
