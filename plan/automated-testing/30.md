# TASK-030: Add tests for hasExistingJobs

**Section**: 3. QueueManager Enhancements
**Subsection**: 3.3
**Task ID**: TASK-030

**NOTE**: This task has been split into granular subtasks:
- **TASK-030.1**: Test hasExistingJobs - matching jobs with excludeActive=false
- **TASK-030.2**: Test hasExistingJobs - excludeActive=true with only active jobs
- **TASK-030.3**: Test hasExistingJobs - error handling

Please execute the subtasks (30.1, 30.2, 30.3) instead of this parent task.

## Description

Add test cases for the `hasExistingJobs` method to verify it correctly checks for existing jobs in a queue based on job names, with support for excluding active jobs. The tests should verify waiting, active, and delayed job detection, and error handling when BullMQ methods throw.

**This task has been split into subtasks - see TASK-030.1 through TASK-030.3**
