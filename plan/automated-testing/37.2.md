# TASK-037.2: Test task-operator internal jobs - processed task case (5000ms delay)

**Section**: 4. PromptProcessor Enhancements
**Subsection**: 4.3.2
**Task ID**: TASK-037.2

## Description

Add a test case for task-operator internal jobs to verify that when a task is successfully processed, the job is re-enqueued with a 5000ms delay. This verifies the happy path re-enqueueing behavior.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/src/queue/prompt-processor.ts` - task-operator internal job handling

## Current State

The `PromptProcessor.process()` method:
- If enabled: calls `TaskOperatorService.processNextTask()`
- Based on result, re-enqueues with appropriate delay:
  - Processed: ~5000ms delay

The test file `tests/queue/prompt-processor.test.ts` exists with previous tests including TASK-037.1.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-037.1.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `PromptProcessor.process()` task-operator handling
- [ ] Understand `TaskOperatorService.processNextTask()` return values
- [ ] Review delay logic (5000ms)
- [ ] Review test setup from TASK-037.1

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Write test for processed task
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should re-enqueue with 5000ms delay when task is processed', async () => { ... })`
  - [ ] Arrange: 
    - [ ] `isTaskOperatorEnabled` returns `true`
    - [ ] `processNextTask` returns `{ processed: true, taskId: 1 }`
  - [ ] Act: Call `promptProcessor.process(job)`
  - [ ] Assert: 
    - [ ] `addDelayedAgent` called with delay ~5000ms

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Test must verify processed task case
  - Acceptance: Re-enqueue with 5000ms delay
- [ ] Requirement 2: Test must verify delay value
  - Acceptance: Delay is approximately 5000ms (allow small variance)

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Verify delay values are approximately correct (allow small variance)
- [ ] Test with various processNextTask return values

### Testing

- [ ] Run `npm run test:unit` to verify test executes
- [ ] Verify test passes consistently
- [ ] Verify existing tests still pass
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests only

### Documentation

- [ ] Add comments explaining delay logic
- [ ] Document why 5000ms delay is used

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes consistently
- [ ] Verify delay logic works
- [ ] Confirm test follows project conventions

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 4 – PromptProcessor Enhancements**
- **Execution Timing**: Should be executed after TASK-037.1
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-037.1: Test task-operator internal jobs - disabled case
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Delay of 5000ms for normal cases
  - Re-enqueueing ensures task operator keeps checking for work
  - This is the second of 5 subtasks for TASK-037
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-037.1
- **Current State**: Test file exists with previous tests

## Related Tasks

- Parent: TASK-037 (Add tests for task-operator internal jobs)
- Previous: TASK-037.1 (Test task-operator internal jobs - disabled case)
- Next: TASK-037.3 (Test task-operator internal jobs - no tasks/lock held case)
- Dependencies:
  - TASK-037.1: Test task-operator internal jobs - disabled case
- Related:
  - TASK-037.1, TASK-037.3, TASK-037.4, TASK-037.5: Other subtasks

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: TESTING TASK

**Description**: This task involves writing a test case for task-operator internal jobs when task is processed.

**Definition of Done**: "A test case is written that verifies task-operator internal jobs are re-enqueued with 5000ms delay when a task is successfully processed. The test passes consistently. All changes have been committed to git and pushed to origin."

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to verify re-enqueueing works so that task operator keeps checking for work.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: 
     - Test verifies re-enqueue occurs with 5000ms delay
     - Test passes consistently

### Automated Tests

The test case should be:

```typescript
describe('task-operator internal jobs', () => {
  it('should re-enqueue with 5000ms delay when task is processed', async () => {
    // Arrange: processNextTask returns { processed: true }
    // Act: promptProcessor.process(job)
    // Assert: addDelayedAgent called with delay ~5000ms
  });
});
```

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Test verifies delay logic

### Git Commit and Push Requirements

- [ ] Test case added to `tests/queue/prompt-processor.test.ts`
- [ ] Commit message follows project conventions (e.g., "test: add task-operator processed task case test")
- [ ] Changes are pushed to origin
- [ ] Commit includes only this test case

### Final Checklist

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Test verifies delay logic
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Code pushed to origin
- [ ] Task marked as complete
