# TASK-047.3: Add tests for delete_queue MCP tool

**Section**: 6. MCP Server Black-box Tests
**Subsection**: 6.2.3
**Task ID**: TASK-047.3

## Description

Add comprehensive test cases for the `delete_queue` MCP tool to verify it correctly deletes queues. The tests should verify it interacts with QueueManager correctly and returns appropriate JSON responses for success and error cases.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/src/mcp/server.ts` - `delete_queue` tool handler
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/tests/mcp/server.test.ts` - existing test structure

## Current State

The `delete_queue` MCP tool:
- Deletes a queue
- Returns MCP response with JSON containing success/error

The test file `tests/mcp/server.test.ts` exists with previous tests including TASK-047.1 and TASK-047.2.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-047.2, completing TASK-047.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `delete_queue` MCP tool implementation
- [ ] Understand `QueueManager.deleteQueue` usage
- [ ] Review test setup from previous subtasks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Write tests for delete_queue
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should delete queue successfully', async () => { ... })`
    - [ ] Arrange: 
      - [ ] Mock `deleteQueue` to resolve
    - [ ] Act: Call `delete_queue` tool
    - [ ] Assert: 
      - [ ] JSON contains success message
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should return error when queue cannot be deleted', async () => { ... })`
    - [ ] Arrange: `deleteQueue` throws error
    - [ ] Act: Call `delete_queue` tool
    - [ ] Assert: 
      - [ ] JSON has `isError: true` with error message

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Test must verify delete_queue
  - Acceptance: Returns success on deletion, error on failure
- [ ] Requirement 2: Test must verify error format
  - Acceptance: Errors have `isError: true` and descriptive messages

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle case where deleteQueue throws
- [ ] Verify error messages are descriptive
- [ ] Test with various queue states

### Testing

- [ ] Run `npm run test:unit` to verify all tests execute
- [ ] Verify all test cases pass
- [ ] Verify existing tests still pass
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests only

### Documentation

- [ ] Add comments explaining queue tool behavior
- [ ] Document error response format

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all test cases pass consistently
- [ ] Verify queue deletion works
- [ ] Verify error handling works
- [ ] Confirm tests follow project conventions

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 6 – MCP Server Black-box Tests**
- **Execution Timing**: Should be executed after TASK-047.2 (completes TASK-047)
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-047.2: Add tests for get_queue_info MCP tool
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Error responses use `isError: true` format
  - Error messages should be user-friendly
  - This is the third and final subtask for TASK-047
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-047.2
- **Current State**: Test file exists with previous tests

## Related Tasks

- Parent: TASK-047 (Add tests for queue-related MCP tools)
- Previous: TASK-047.2 (Add tests for get_queue_info MCP tool)
- Next: TASK-048 (Add tests for MCP resources (agents))
- Dependencies:
  - TASK-047.2: Add tests for get_queue_info MCP tool
- Related:
  - TASK-047.1, TASK-047.2: Other subtasks

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: TESTING TASK

**Description**: This task involves adding test cases for the `delete_queue` MCP tool.

**Definition of Done**: "Test cases are added that verify `delete_queue` MCP tool correctly deletes queues and returns appropriate JSON responses. All tests pass consistently. All changes have been committed to git and pushed to origin."

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to verify queue deletion works so that MCP clients can delete queues.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Test verifies successful deletion returns success
     - Test verifies errors return isError format

### Automated Tests

Test cases should include:

```typescript
describe('delete_queue MCP tool', () => {
  it('should delete queue successfully', async () => {
    // Arrange: deleteQueue resolves
    // Act: Call delete_queue tool
    // Assert: JSON contains success message
  });
  
  it('should return error when queue cannot be deleted', async () => {
    // Arrange: deleteQueue throws
    // Act: Call delete_queue tool
    // Assert: JSON has isError: true, error message
  });
});
```

- [ ] All test cases written and pass
- [ ] Tests verify delete_queue
- [ ] Tests verify error handling

### Git Commit and Push Requirements

- [ ] Test cases added to `tests/mcp/server.test.ts`
- [ ] Commit message follows project conventions (e.g., "test: add delete_queue MCP tool tests")
- [ ] Changes are pushed to origin
- [ ] Commit includes only the test case additions

### Final Checklist

- [ ] All test cases written and pass
- [ ] Tests verify delete_queue
- [ ] Tests verify error handling
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Code pushed to origin
- [ ] Task marked as complete
- [ ] **TASK-047 (all subtasks) is complete**
