# TASK-043.2: Add tests for DELETE /task-operator endpoint

**Section**: 5. HTTP/API Black-box Tests (App)
**Subsection**: 5.6.2
**Task ID**: TASK-043.2

## Description

Add test cases for the `DELETE /task-operator` endpoint to verify it correctly disables the task operator by setting the system setting and removing the agent. The tests should verify success cases and error handling.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/src/app.ts` - `DELETE /task-operator` endpoint
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/tests/app.test.ts` - existing test structure

## Current State

The `DELETE /task-operator` endpoint:
- Disables task operator by setting system setting
- Removes agent
- Returns 200 on success
- Returns 500 when setSystemSetting returns false

The test file `tests/app.test.ts` exists with previous tests including TASK-043.1.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-043.1, completing TASK-043.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `DELETE /task-operator` endpoint implementation
- [ ] Understand `setSystemSetting` and `removeAgent` usage
- [ ] Review test setup from TASK-043.1

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Write tests for DELETE /task-operator
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should disable task operator successfully', async () => { ... })`
    - [ ] Arrange: 
      - [ ] Mock `setSystemSetting` to return `true`
      - [ ] Mock `removeAgent` to resolve
    - [ ] Act: DELETE `/task-operator`
    - [ ] Assert: 
      - [ ] 200, success JSON
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should handle removeAgent not found error', async () => { ... })`
    - [ ] Arrange: `removeAgent` throws "not found" error (should be ignored)
    - [ ] Act: DELETE `/task-operator`
    - [ ] Assert: 
      - [ ] 200, success (error ignored)
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should return 500 when setSystemSetting returns false', async () => { ... })`
    - [ ] Arrange: `setSystemSetting` returns `false`
    - [ ] Act: DELETE `/task-operator`
    - [ ] Assert: 
      - [ ] 500, error "Failed to disable task operator", `removeAgent` not called

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Test must verify DELETE success cases
  - Acceptance: Task operator is disabled successfully
- [ ] Requirement 2: Test must verify DELETE error handling
  - Acceptance: Errors return 500, not found errors are ignored

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle case where removeAgent throws "not found" (should be ignored)
- [ ] Verify setSystemSetting false is error in DELETE (unlike POST)
- [ ] Test with various error types

### Testing

- [ ] Run `npm run test:http` to verify all tests execute
- [ ] Verify all test cases pass
- [ ] Verify existing tests still pass
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests only

### Documentation

- [ ] Add comments explaining task operator disable flow
- [ ] Document why setSystemSetting false is error in DELETE vs warning in POST

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all test cases pass consistently
- [ ] Verify disable functionality works
- [ ] Verify error handling works
- [ ] Confirm tests follow project conventions

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 5 – HTTP/API Black-box Tests (App)**
- **Execution Timing**: Should be executed after TASK-043.1 (completes TASK-043)
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-043.1: Add tests for POST /task-operator endpoint
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - DELETE endpoint disables task operator and removes agent
  - setSystemSetting false in DELETE is error (unlike POST which is warning)
  - removeAgent "not found" error should be ignored (agent may not exist)
  - This is the second and final subtask for TASK-043
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-043.1
- **Current State**: Test file exists with previous tests

## Related Tasks

- Parent: TASK-043 (Add tests for /task-operator endpoints)
- Previous: TASK-043.1 (Add tests for POST /task-operator endpoint)
- Next: TASK-044 (Add tests for /task-operator/lock endpoints)
- Dependencies:
  - TASK-043.1: Add tests for POST /task-operator endpoint
- Related:
  - TASK-043.1: Other subtask

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: TESTING TASK

**Description**: This task involves adding test cases for the `DELETE /task-operator` endpoint.

**Definition of Done**: "Test cases are added that verify `DELETE /task-operator` correctly disables task operator, handles various success scenarios, and handles errors gracefully. All tests pass consistently. All changes have been committed to git and pushed to origin."

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to verify task operator disablement works so that task processing can be stopped.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Test verifies task operator is disabled successfully
     - Test verifies agent is removed
     - Test verifies not found errors are ignored

### Automated Tests

Test cases should include:

```typescript
describe('DELETE /task-operator', () => {
  it('should disable task operator successfully', async () => {
    // Arrange: setSystemSetting true, removeAgent resolves
    // Act: DELETE /task-operator
    // Assert: 200, success
  });
  
  it('should handle removeAgent not found error', async () => {
    // Arrange: removeAgent throws "not found"
    // Act & Assert: 200, error ignored
  });
  
  it('should return 500 when setSystemSetting returns false', async () => {
    // Arrange: setSystemSetting false
    // Act & Assert: 500, "Failed to disable task operator"
  });
});
```

- [ ] All test cases written and pass
- [ ] Tests verify disable functionality
- [ ] Tests verify error handling

### Git Commit and Push Requirements

- [ ] Test cases added to `tests/app.test.ts`
- [ ] Commit message follows project conventions (e.g., "test: add DELETE /task-operator endpoint tests")
- [ ] Changes are pushed to origin
- [ ] Commit includes only the test case additions

### Final Checklist

- [ ] All test cases written and pass
- [ ] Tests verify disable functionality
- [ ] Tests verify error handling
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Code pushed to origin
- [ ] Task marked as complete
- [ ] **TASK-043 (all subtasks) is complete**
