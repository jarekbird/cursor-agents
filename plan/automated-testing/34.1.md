# TASK-034.1: Test deleteQueue - queue not found error

**Section**: 3. QueueManager Enhancements
**Subsection**: 3.7.1
**Task ID**: TASK-034.1

## Description

Add a test case for the `deleteQueue` method to verify it correctly throws an error when attempting to delete a queue that doesn't exist.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/src/queue/queue-manager.ts` - `deleteQueue()` method

## Current State

The `deleteQueue` method:
- Validates queue exists
- Throws error if queue is not found

The test file `tests/queue/queue-manager.test.ts` exists but may not have comprehensive `deleteQueue` tests.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-033. This is the first subtask of TASK-034.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `deleteQueue` implementation
- [ ] Understand validation logic
- [ ] Review existing test structure

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Write test for queue not found
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should throw error when queue is not found', async () => { ... })`
  - [ ] Arrange: Queue name that doesn't exist
  - [ ] Act: Call `deleteQueue('non-existent')`
  - [ ] Assert: Throws expected error

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Test must verify validation error
  - Acceptance: Appropriate error thrown for non-existent queue

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Verify error messages are descriptive
- [ ] Test with various queue names

### Testing

- [ ] Run `npm run test:unit` to verify test executes
- [ ] Verify test passes consistently
- [ ] Verify existing tests still pass
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests only

### Documentation

- [ ] Add comments explaining validation error

### Verification

- [ ] Verify test passes consistently
- [ ] Verify validation works
- [ ] Confirm test follows project conventions

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 3 – QueueManager Enhancements**
- **Execution Timing**: Should be executed after TASK-033
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-033: Add tests for removeAgent and checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - This is the first of 4 subtasks for TASK-034
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-033
- **Current State**: Test file exists but may not have comprehensive deleteQueue tests

## Related Tasks

- Parent: TASK-034 (Add tests for deleteQueue)
- Next: TASK-034.2 (Test deleteQueue - default queue protection)
- Dependencies:
  - TASK-033: Add tests for removeAgent and checkAndCleanupEmptyQueue
- Related:
  - TASK-034.2, TASK-034.3, TASK-034.4: Other subtasks

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: TESTING TASK

**Description**: This task involves writing a test case for `deleteQueue` when queue is not found.

**Definition of Done**: "A test case is written that verifies `deleteQueue` correctly throws an error when attempting to delete a non-existent queue. The test passes consistently. All changes have been committed to git and pushed to origin."

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to verify validation works so that queues aren't deleted inappropriately.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: 
     - Test verifies not found error is thrown
     - Test passes consistently

### Automated Tests

The test case should be:

```typescript
describe('deleteQueue', () => {
  it('should throw error when queue is not found', async () => {
    // Arrange: Queue doesn't exist
    // Act & Assert: Throws error
  });
});
```

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Test verifies validation error

### Git Commit and Push Requirements

- [ ] Test case added to `tests/queue/queue-manager.test.ts`
- [ ] Commit message follows project conventions (e.g., "test: add deleteQueue not found error test")
- [ ] Changes are pushed to origin
- [ ] Commit includes only this test case

### Final Checklist

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Test verifies validation
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Code pushed to origin
- [ ] Task marked as complete
