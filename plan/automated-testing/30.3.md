# TASK-030.3: Test hasExistingJobs - error handling

**Section**: 3. QueueManager Enhancements
**Subsection**: 3.3.3
**Task ID**: TASK-030.3

## Description

Add a test case for the `hasExistingJobs` method to verify it correctly handles errors when BullMQ methods throw. The test should verify that errors return false and are logged appropriately.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/src/queue/queue-manager.ts` - `hasExistingJobs()` method error handling
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/tests/queue/queue-manager.test.ts` - existing test structure

## Current State

The `hasExistingJobs` method:
- Handles errors by logging and returning `false`

The test file `tests/queue/queue-manager.test.ts` exists with previous tests including TASK-030.1 and TASK-030.2.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-030.2, completing TASK-030.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `hasExistingJobs` error handling implementation
- [ ] Understand error logging patterns
- [ ] Review test setup from previous subtasks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Write test for error handling
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should return false and log error when BullMQ methods throw', async () => { ... })`
  - [ ] Arrange: 
    - [ ] Mock queue methods to throw errors
  - [ ] Act: Call `hasExistingJobs(queue, 'agent:test', false)`
  - [ ] Assert: 
    - [ ] Returns `false`
    - [ ] Error is logged

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Test must verify error handling
  - Acceptance: Errors return `false` and are logged
- [ ] Requirement 2: Test must verify error logging
  - Acceptance: Errors are logged appropriately

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Test with various error types
- [ ] Verify logging occurs correctly

### Testing

- [ ] Run `npm run test:unit` to verify all tests execute
- [ ] Verify all test cases pass
- [ ] Verify existing tests still pass
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests only

### Documentation

- [ ] Add comments explaining error handling approach
- [ ] Note error handling approach

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all test cases pass consistently
- [ ] Verify error handling works
- [ ] Verify error logging works
- [ ] Confirm tests follow project conventions

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 3 – QueueManager Enhancements**
- **Execution Timing**: Should be executed after TASK-030.2 (completes TASK-030)
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-030.2: Test hasExistingJobs - excludeActive=true with only active jobs
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Error handling ensures method doesn't crash on BullMQ failures
  - This is the third and final subtask for TASK-030
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-030.2
- **Current State**: Test file exists with previous tests

## Related Tasks

- Parent: TASK-030 (Add tests for hasExistingJobs)
- Previous: TASK-030.2 (Test hasExistingJobs - excludeActive=true with only active jobs)
- Next: TASK-031 (Add tests for addDelayedAgent)
- Dependencies:
  - TASK-030.2: Test hasExistingJobs - excludeActive=true with only active jobs
- Related:
  - TASK-030.1, TASK-030.2: Other subtasks

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: TESTING TASK

**Description**: This task involves writing a test case for `hasExistingJobs` error handling.

**Definition of Done**: "A test case is written that verifies `hasExistingJobs` correctly handles errors when BullMQ methods throw, returning false and logging errors appropriately. The test passes consistently. All changes have been committed to git and pushed to origin."

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to verify error handling works so that the method doesn't crash on failures.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Test verifies errors return false
     - Test verifies errors are logged

### Automated Tests

The test case should be:

```typescript
describe('hasExistingJobs', () => {
  it('should return false and log error when BullMQ methods throw', async () => {
    // Arrange: Methods throw
    const mockQueue = {
      getWaiting: jest.fn().mockRejectedValue(new Error('Queue error')),
      getActive: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue([]),
      getDelayed: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue([]),
    };
    
    // Act
    const result = await queueManager.hasExistingJobs(mockQueue, 'agent:test', false);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe(false);
    // Verify error logged
  });
});
```

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Tests verify error handling
- [ ] Tests verify error logging

### Git Commit and Push Requirements

- [ ] Test case added to `tests/queue/queue-manager.test.ts`
- [ ] Commit message follows project conventions (e.g., "test: add hasExistingJobs error handling test")
- [ ] Changes are pushed to origin
- [ ] Commit includes only this test case

### Final Checklist

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Tests verify error handling
- [ ] Tests verify error logging
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Code pushed to origin
- [ ] Task marked as complete
- [ ] **TASK-030 (all subtasks) is complete**
