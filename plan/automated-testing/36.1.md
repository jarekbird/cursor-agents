# TASK-036.1: Test no re-enqueue - missing requeue flag

**Section**: 4. PromptProcessor Enhancements
**Subsection**: 4.2.1
**Task ID**: TASK-036.1

## Description

Add a test case to verify that re-enqueueing does NOT occur when the HTTP response lacks the `requeue` flag. The test should verify that `addDelayedAgent` is not called and normal processing continues.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/src/queue/prompt-processor.ts` - re-enqueueing conditional logic
- `virtual-assistant/cursor-agents/tests/queue/prompt-processor.test.ts` - existing test structure

## Current State

The `PromptProcessor.process()` method:
- Only calls `addDelayedAgent` when response has `requeue: true`
- Does not re-enqueue when `requeue` is missing
- Normal processing continues without re-enqueueing

The test file `tests/queue/prompt-processor.test.ts` exists with re-enqueueing tests from TASK-035.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-035. This is the first subtask of TASK-036.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `PromptProcessor.process()` conditional logic
- [ ] Understand when requeue flag is checked
- [ ] Review existing re-enqueueing tests
- [ ] Understand normal processing flow

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Write test for missing requeue flag
  - [ ] Create test: `it('should not re-enqueue when requeue flag is missing', async () => { ... })`
  - [ ] Arrange: 
    - [ ] Mock HTTP response without `requeue` field
    - [ ] Set up spy on `addDelayedAgent`
  - [ ] Act: Call `promptProcessor.process(job)`
  - [ ] Assert: 
    - [ ] `addDelayedAgent` not called
    - [ ] Normal processing completes

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Test must verify no re-enqueue when flag missing
  - Acceptance: `addDelayedAgent` not called
- [ ] Requirement 2: Test must verify normal processing
  - Acceptance: Processing completes normally

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle case where response is not JSON
- [ ] Handle case where response is empty
- [ ] Test with various response structures

### Testing

- [ ] Run `npm run test:unit` to verify all tests execute
- [ ] Verify all test cases pass
- [ ] Verify existing tests still pass
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests only

### Documentation

- [ ] Add comments explaining conditional logic
- [ ] Document when re-enqueue does not occur

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all test cases pass consistently
- [ ] Verify no false positives (re-enqueue when shouldn't)
- [ ] Verify normal processing works
- [ ] Confirm tests follow project conventions

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 4 – PromptProcessor Enhancements**
- **Execution Timing**: Should be executed after TASK-035
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-035: Extend prompt-processor.test.ts for re-enqueueing
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Negative test cases are important for ensuring correct behavior
  - Flag must be explicitly `true` to trigger re-enqueue
  - This is the first of 2 subtasks for TASK-036
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-035
- **Current State**: Test file exists with re-enqueueing tests

## Related Tasks

- Parent: TASK-036 (Add tests for no re-enqueue conditions)
- Next: TASK-036.2 (Test no re-enqueue - requeue: false)
- Dependencies:
  - TASK-035: Extend prompt-processor.test.ts for re-enqueueing
- Related:
  - TASK-035: Tested positive re-enqueue cases
  - TASK-036.2: Will test requeue: false case

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: TESTING TASK

**Description**: This task involves writing a test case for when re-enqueueing does NOT occur due to missing requeue flag.

**Definition of Done**: "A test case is written that verifies re-enqueueing does not occur when `requeue` flag is missing, and normal processing continues. The test passes consistently. All changes have been committed to git and pushed to origin."

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to verify re-enqueue only occurs when explicitly requested so that agents don't re-enqueue unnecessarily.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: 
     - Test verifies no re-enqueue when flag missing
     - Test verifies normal processing continues
     - Test passes consistently

### Automated Tests

The test case should be:

```typescript
describe('no re-enqueue conditions', () => {
  it('should not re-enqueue when requeue flag is missing', async () => {
    // Arrange: Response without requeue field
    const mockQueueManager = {
      addDelayedAgent: jest.fn(),
    };
    const processor = new PromptProcessor(mockQueueManager);
    global.fetch = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
      ok: true,
      json: () => Promise.resolve({ success: true }), // No requeue field
    });
    
    // Act
    await processor.process({ data: jobData });
    
    // Assert
    expect(mockQueueManager.addDelayedAgent).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
```

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Tests verify no re-enqueue when flag missing
- [ ] Tests verify normal processing

### Git Commit and Push Requirements

- [ ] Test case added to `tests/queue/prompt-processor.test.ts`
- [ ] Commit message follows project conventions (e.g., "test: add no re-enqueue missing flag test")
- [ ] Changes are pushed to origin
- [ ] Commit includes only this test case

### Final Checklist

- [ ] Test case written and passes
- [ ] Tests verify no false positives
- [ ] Tests verify normal processing
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Code pushed to origin
- [ ] Task marked as complete
